In the beginning, the dimension in which we exist today was utterly empty. Unoccupied space stretched out in all directions, for distances unfathomable. There was no matter, energy, light, or darkness. For eons, such was our dimension: lonely and barren.

Searching for ways to expand eir influence, Murgorhd, god of darkness, arrived at last. Pleased with finding an untouched dimension, e was quick to bathe the entire expanse in cold, unforgiving darkness.

Itulvatar, god of light, was well aware of Murgorhd's efforts to further the reaches of darkness. Arriving shortly after Murgorhd, Itulvatar was at first dispirited to find an entire dimension engulfed in gloom. Although e could not completely undo Murgorhd's work, e could counteract it with some efforts of eir own. Itulvatar created countless stars - massive beacons of light and warmth - and dispersed them all across our dimension. Itulvatar's stars broke through the pervasive darkness, illuminating our dimension where they could.

Itulvatar was happy with eir work, but not entirely satisfied with the end result. E felt our dimension needed something more to make it truly special. E called upon Rumialys, god of nature, and gave him the task of blessing our dimension with life.

Rumialys chose our sun, one of Itulvatar's stars, as the setting for his work. He created the planet Rumia and set it in orbit about the sun. He spun Rumia on its axis, creating day and night for its inhabitants, who would then experience both light and darkness for themselves. Such began year 0 as measured by the calendar we have today.

Feeling inspired, Rumialys spent the next 100 years populating Rumia with life and spirit. First he created the biped races, blessing them with exceptional intelligence. He then gave birth to a great variety of plants and animals, beginning with cats, rabbits, and foxes (four-legged creatures conceived in the image of felinoids, lagomorphs, and vulpenoids, respectively).

Drogo was watching close by. Not long after Rumialys began creating life as we know it, Drogo keenly observed that our dimension was developing into something novel and exciting. Wanting to leave his own mark, he created the moon, setting it in orbit about Rumia. He spent the next 100 years instilling in the moon a great interlacing of complex magical forces. The bipedal races, blessed with sufficient faculties and talent, could harness the magic radiated by the moon. And so Drogo became known to us as god of the moon and magic.

Celoriel, Drogo's wife, was jealous of all the time he was spending away from her, engrossed in the invention of magical forces. She was, however, secretly impressed with his work. Wondering if she could one-up him by doing even better, Celoriel pondered if life on Rumia could be further enhanced by a separate system of forces inspired by Drogo's magic.

Instead of creating an external source of power as Drogo did with the moon, Celoriel focused on the spirituality of Rumia's lifeforms.
