IN THE BEGINNING: the story of the our dimension and the gods that shaped it

PREFACE

Here I strive to put down in writing the most simple and accurate account of the creation of our universe. This modern version of the story is popularly accepted by the majority of all the bipeds today.

But first, a note on pronouns.

Over the years, the bipeds have developed personified images of the gods (Aule as male dwarf, Caila as female human, etc.) While these personifications are still quite popular today, modern scholars are keen to emphasize that the gods are highly abstract entities to which notions of race and gender do not/should not apply. In this text, however, I've decided to keep with the norm of using familiar pronouns, reflecting the genders of these common personifications.

Historically, the bipeds have never agreed upon personifications for Itulvatar and Murgorhd (perhaps this is fitting, as these two gods often are the most intellectually nebulous to our lesser minds). In this text I refer to Itulvatar and Murgorhd using male pronouns, simply by default.

In the beginning, the dimension in which we exist today was utterly empty. Unoccupied space stretched out in all directions, for distances unfathomable. There was no matter, energy, light, or darkness. For eons such was our dimension: lonely and barren.

Searching for ways to expand his influence, Murgorhd, god of darkness, arrived at last. Pleased with finding an untouched dimension, he was quick to bathe the entire expanse in cold, unforgiving darkness.

Itulvatar, god of light, was well aware of Murgorhd's efforts to further the reaches of darkness. Arriving shortly after Murgorhd, Itulvatar was at first dispirited to find an entire dimension engulfed in gloom. Although he could not completely undo Murgorhd's work, he could counteract it with some efforts of his own. Itulvatar created countless stars - massive beacons of light and warmth - and dispersed them all across our dimension. The countless stars broke through the pervasive darkness, providing illuminating where they could.

Itulvatar was happy with his work, but not entirely satisfied with the end result. He felt our dimension needed something more to make it truly special. He called upon Rumialys, god of nature, and gave him the task of populating our dimension with life.

Rumialys chose our sun, one of Itulvatar's stars, as the setting for his work. He created the planet Rumia and set it in orbit about the sun. He spun Rumia on its axis (thereby creating day and night), so Rumia's inhabitants would experience both light and darkness for themselves. Such began year 0 as measured by the calendar we have today.

Feeling inspired, Rumialys spent the next 100 years populating Rumia with life and spirit. First he created the bipeds, blessing them with exceptional intelligence. He then gave birth to a great variety of plants and animals, beginning with cats, rabbits, and foxes (four-legged creatures conceived in the image of felinoids, lagomorphs, and vulpenoids, respectively).

Drogo was watching close by. Not long after Rumialys began creating life as we know it, Drogo keenly observed that our dimension was quickly developing into something novel and exciting. Wanting to leave his own mark, he created the moon, setting it in orbit about Rumia. Drogo spent the next 100 years instilling in the moon a great interlacing of magical forces. The bipeds, blessed with sufficient faculties and talent, could harness the magic radiated by the moon. And so Drogo became known to us as god of the moon and magic.

Celoriel, Drogo's wife, was jealous of all the time he was spending away from her, engrossed in the invention of magical forces. She was, however, secretly impressed with his work. Hoping to one-up him by doing even better, Celoriel pondered if life on Rumia could be further enhanced by a system of forces inspired by, but distinctly separate from, Drogo's magic.

Instead of creating an external source of power as Drogo did with the moon, Celoriel focused on the minds and spirituality of Rumia's more advanced lifeforms. She spent the next 100 years creating complex, intangible forces flowing through all life on Rumia, forces that could be manipulated by a trained mind and disciplined spirit. To all members of the bipeds she gave the natural ability to link minds and communicate telepathically. And so Celoriel became known to us as the god of psionics.

Having worked so hard for so long, Drogo and Celoriel rested for 50 years while passively observing the unfolding influence of magic and psionics upon life on Rumia. During this time they mated repeatedly, and Celoriel gave birth to three more gods: Aule, Caila, and Iminye. To each of their offspring they assigned the task of regulating and embellishing a particular aspect of bipedal life and culture. Aule became the god of wealth, Caila the god of harvest, and Iminye the god of art and engineering.

The birth of three new gods was not overlooked by Murgorhd, who was especially smitten by Iminye. Boasting of extraordinary power and promising to teach her how to wield it for herself, he charmed Iminye, luring her far away from her parents. He then seduced her, only to abandon her shortly thereafter.

A pregnant Iminye went on to give birth to two more gods: Dellio and Rha'yk. Although it was her intention to raise them by herself, after a few short years they fled to live under the dark shadow of their father, much to Iminye's dismay. Murgorhd designated Dellio the god of debauchery, and Rha'yk the god of war.
