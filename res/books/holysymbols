PREFACE: On The Topic Of Holy Symbols...

A holy symbol is a divine object principally used in the ceremonial sacrifice of a corpse. The curious nature of holy symbols is this: when one is used in a proper sacrifice, the corpse always vanishes. Only when a holy symbol is used will the corpse vanish; any sacrifice attempted without a holy symbol is doomed to fail as an \uimproper\n sacrifice.

The application of a holy symbol is simple: lay the divine object upon the corpse and say a prayer for the soul of the departed. A humble and sincere prayer is most ideal. Do it respectfully, acknowledging that the act is a ritual; it is a ceremony (however big or small).

What happens when a corpse is sacrificed? As mentioned above, the corpse disappears. An intriguing question is that of the fate of the soul. While the various churches of the world may propose their own embellishments upon the story, the common explanation seen throughout history suggests that the soul of the departed is entrusted to the god whose holy symbol is used. Said god guides the soul through the afterlife and on to the next existence in another dimension.

The creation of holy symbols is another topic of great interest. What makes a holy symbol a holy symbol? In fact, an object becomes a holy symbol when it is formally blessed by a devotee. The precise prayers uttered is secret knowledge, well-guarded by the churches and passed down throughout the ages.

RUMIALYS: god of nature

[There is an illustration of a steel ring. A single thin bar runs through the center and connects two opposites edges of the ring.]
The holy symbol of Rumialys is a steel ring, about four inches wide, with a single thin bar running through the center and connecting two opposites edges of the ring.

The ring - a perfect circle - symbolizes both our planet Rumia as well as the many cyclic patterns that may be observed in nature. The center bar that runs the diameter of the circle represents the divine energy of Rumialys, and its presence in all of nature.
