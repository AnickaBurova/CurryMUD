UNDERSTANDING HOLY SYMBOLS: The Illustrated Guide
Written in the year 4099 by Eldwara Droiph, human Scholar of History and Religion.

PART 1: On The Topic Of Holy Symbols

A holy symbol is a divine object principally used in the ceremonial sacrifice of a corpse. The curious nature of holy symbols is this: when one is applied in a \uproper\n sacrifice, the corpse is sure to vanish. Only when a holy symbol is used will the corpse vanish; any sacrifice attempted without a holy symbol is doomed to fail as an \uimproper\n sacrifice.

In addition to the presence of a holy symbol, the other ingredients of a proper sacrifice are 1) the application of the holy symbol, and 2) the prayer. One must \uapply\n the holy symbol: lay the divine object upon the corpse, and say a \uprayer\n for the soul of the deceased. A humble and sincere prayer is most ideal.
Above all, carry out the sacrifice respectfully, acknowledging that the act is a ritual; it is a ceremony (however big or small). Do these things and your sacrifice will succeed.

An intriguing question is that of the fate of the soul. While the various churches of the world may propose their own embellishments upon the story, the universal explanation seen throughout history suggests that the soul of the departed is entrusted to the god whose holy symbol is used in the sacrifice. Said god guides the soul through the afterlife and on to the next existence in another dimension.

The astute reader is at this point surely wondering about the corpse. It vanishes, yes; but does it cease to exist entirely? Is it transported to some other place? Alas, there is no universally accepted answer to such questions. The churches offer their own varied explanations; I won't be delving any further into the matter here as it is outside the scope of this document.

The creation of holy symbols is another topic of great interest. What makes a holy symbol a holy symbol? As a simple matter of fact, an object becomes a holy symbol when it is formally blessed by a cleric of a church. The precise prayers uttered when designating a holy symbol is secret knowledge, passed down throughout the ages and well-guarded by the churches.

The actual object that constitutes a holy symbol varies by church. Holy symbols have evolved over history, in the sense that the churches have officially produced holy symbols of a variety of description, never settling on any one specification for more than a few hundred years. Until recently, that is, as no church has imposed a change upon its holy symbol for at least the last 850 years.

Part 2 of this document is concerned with modern holy symbol design. Every holy symbol is at once both a practical object and an object of great symbolism. Understanding the symbolism is a worthy goal of both believers and scholars alike.

AULE: god of wealth

CAILA: god of the harvest

[There is an illustration of a small, white, rectangular cloth bag. The bag is sewn shut, and a vertical series of four runes is embroidered upon its cloth surface.]

The holy symbol of Caila is a rectangular cloth bag containing "ine," or purified rice; that is, rice blessed by a cleric of Caila during "Maturi." Maturi is a harvest festival officially held by the Church of Caila in the month of Lush Lun. During the festival, rice gifted by farmers is blessed in a lively ceremony that includes music and dancing. This ine - purified rice - is kept on hand, to become the contents of the holy symbols produced by the church throughout the year.

The runes embroidered on the surface of the holy symbol are from "shigo," a script used by ancient humans before the adoption of the modern hominal alphabet. Translated to common, the runes read, "blessed harvest sacred life." The runes are always embroidered in vermillion thread, vermillion being a color commonly found in church architecture (in addition, clerics of Caila don stark white robes with vermillion trimming - it's quite striking).

(It should be noted that "ine," "Maturi," and "shigo" are hominal words.)

ITULVATAR: god of light

[There is an illustration of a large coin with a picture embossed upon it.]

The holy symbol of Itulvatar is a thick bronze disc, four inches in diameter. On the front is an illustration of a large torch burning fiercely, set upon a backdrop of rays of sunlight spreading high above the horizon.
The fire represents the precious, primal energy of light and warmth, while the rays are meant to be that of our own sun.

One the back of the disc, the following prayer is engraved in common:
Beloved Itulvatar,
Architect of Stars,
(may your Light bathe all existence):
I humbly offer myself to You,
that your Light may guide me
through all darkness and calamity.

MURGORHD: god of darkness

[There is an illustration of ...]

(At the time of this writing the Church of Murgorhd remains, as always, illegal, underground, and highly unpopular. Here I document the design of the holy symbol purely out of academic interest.)

No holy symbol has changed throughout history as much as that of Murgorhd. Historical records suggest that for thousands of years the church was too disorganized to settle on a standard for very long. Attempts at clandestine, amateur holy symbols were not uncommon.
But these days are long gone. The fact that the design has remained stable for the last 850 years now speaks, most unfortunately, to the stability of the modern church itself.
The holy symbol of Murgorhd is a...

RUMIALYS: god of nature

[There is an illustration of a metal ring. Words are etched upon its outer surface. A single thin, straight bar runs through the center and connects two opposites edges of the ring.]

The holy symbol of Rumialys is a simple object of deep symbolism: a steel ring with a bar running the length of its four-inch diameter. The ring - a perfect circle - symbolizes both our planet Rumia, as well as the many cyclic patterns that may be observed in nature. The bar through the ring's center represents the divine energy of Rumialys, and how its presence may be observed across all existence. "Mother of Life, Architect of All" is etched in naelyni along the outside of the ring (it is with these six words that formal prayers to Rumialys most often end).
