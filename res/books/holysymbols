UNDERSTANDING HOLY SYMBOLS: The Illustrated Guide
Written in the year 4099 by Eldwara Droiph, human Scholar of History and Religion.

PART 1: On The Topic Of Holy Symbols

A holy symbol is a divine object principally used in the ceremonial sacrifice of a corpse. The curious nature of holy symbols is this: when one is applied in a \uproper\n sacrifice, the corpse is sure to vanish. Only when a holy symbol is used will the corpse vanish; any sacrifice attempted without a holy symbol is doomed to fail as an \uimproper\n sacrifice.

In addition to the presence of a holy symbol, the other ingredients of a proper sacrifice are the 1) application of the holy symbol, and 2) the prayer. One must \uapply\n the holy symbol: lay the divine object upon the corpse, and say a \uprayer\n for the soul of the deceased. A humble and sincere prayer is most ideal.
Above all, carry out the sacrifice respectfully, acknowledging that the act is a ritual; it is a ceremony (however big or small). Do these things and your sacrifice will succeed.

An intriguing question is that of the fate of the soul. While the various churches of the world may propose their own embellishments upon the story, the universal explanation seen throughout history suggests that the soul of the departed is entrusted to the god whose holy symbol is used in the sacrifice. Said god guides the soul through the afterlife and on to the next existence in another dimension.

The astute reader is at this point surely wondering about the corpse. It vanishes, yes; but does it cease to exist entirely? Is it transported to some other place? Alas, there is no universally accepted answer to such questions. The churches offer their own varied explanations; I won't be delving any further into the matter here as it is outside the scope of this document.

The creation of holy symbols is another topic of great interest. What makes a holy symbol a holy symbol? As a simple matter of fact, an object becomes a holy symbol when it is formally blessed by a cleric of a church. The precise prayers uttered when designating a holy symbol is secret knowledge, passed down throughout the ages and well-guarded by the churches.

The actual object that constitutes a holy symbol varies by church. Holy symbols have evolved over history, in the sense that the churches have officially produced holy symbols of a variety of description, never settling on any one specification for more than a few hundred years. Until recently, that is, as no church has imposed a change upon its holy symbol for at least the last 850 years.

Part 2 of this document is concerned with modern holy symbol design. Every holy symbol is at once both a practical object and an object of great symbolism. Understanding the symbolism is a worthy goal of both believers and scholars alike.

PART 2: The Illustrated Guide

CAILA: god of the harvest

[There is an illustration of a small, white, rectangular cloth bag. The bag is sewn shut, and a vertical series of four runes is embroidered upon its cloth surface.]

A holy symbol of Caila is a rectangular cloth bag containing "ine," or purified rice; that is, rice blessed by a cleric of Caila during "Maturi." Maturi is a harvest festival officially held by the Church of Caila in the month of Lush Lun. During the festival, rice gifted by farmers is blessed in a ritualistic ceremony. This ine - purified rice - is kept on hand, to become the contents of the holy symbols produced by the church.

The runes are from "shigo," a script used by ancient humans before the adoption of the modern hominal alphabet. Translated to common, the runes read, "blessed harvest sacred life." The runes are always embroidered in vermillion thread, vermillion being a color commonly found in church architecture (in addition, clerics of Caila don stark white robes with vermillion trimming - it's quite striking).

(It should be noted that "ine," "Maturi," and "shigo" are words from the hominal language.)

MURGORHD: god of darkness

[There is an illustration of a compass pointing south.]

No holy symbol has changed throughout history as much as that of Murgorhd. The fact that the design has remained stable for the last 850 years speaks, most unfortunately, to the stability of the modern church. The days of clandestine, amateur holy symbols are long gone. At the time of this writing the Church of Murgorhd remains, as always, illegal, underground, and highly unpopular. But the design of the holy symbol is by now common knowledge, and I document it here only out of a purely academic interest.

The holy symbol of Murgorhd is a compass pointing south - that is, a compass that \ualways\n points south.

RUMIALYS: god of nature

[There is an illustration of a metal ring. There is something etched on its outer surface. A single thin bar runs through the center and connects two opposites edges of the ring.]

The holy symbol of Rumialys is a simple object of deep symbolism: a steel ring with a bar running along its four inch diameter. The ring - a perfect circle - symbolizes both our planet Rumia as well as the many cyclic patterns that may be observed in nature. The bar represents the divine energy of Rumialys, and how its presence may be observed across all existence. "Mother of Life, Architect of All" is etched in naelyni along the outside of the ring.
