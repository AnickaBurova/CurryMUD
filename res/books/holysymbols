UNDERSTANDING HOLY SYMBOLS: The Illustrated Guide
Written in the year 4099 by Eldwara Droiph, human Scholar of History and Religion.

PART 1: On The Topic Of Holy Symbols

A holy symbol is a divine object principally used in the ceremonial sacrifice of a corpse. The curious nature of holy symbols is this: when one is applied in a \uproper\n sacrifice, the corpse is sure to vanish. Only when a holy symbol is used will the corpse vanish; any sacrifice attempted without a holy symbol is doomed to fail as an \uimproper\n sacrifice.

In addition to the presence of a holy symbol, the other ingredients of a proper sacrifice are the application of the holy symbol and the prayer. One must \uapply\n the holy symbol: lay the divine object upon the corpse, and say a \uprayer\n for the soul of the deceased. A humble and sincere prayer is most ideal.
Above all, carry out the sacrifice respectfully, acknowledging that the act is a ritual; it is a ceremony (however big or small). Do these things and your sacrifice will succeed.

An intriguing question is that of the fate of the soul. While the various churches of the world may propose their own embellishments upon the story, the universal explanation seen throughout history suggests that the soul of the departed is entrusted to the god whose holy symbol is used. Said god guides the soul through the afterlife and on to the next existence in another dimension.

The astute reader is at this point surely wondering about the corpse. It vanishes, yes; but does it cease to exist entirely? Is it transported to some other place? Alas, there is no universally accepted answer to such questions. The churches offer their own varied explanations; I won't be delving any further into the matter here as it is outside the scope of this document.

The creation of holy symbols is another topic of great interest. What makes a holy symbol a holy symbol? As a matter of fact, an object becomes a holy symbol when it is formally blessed by a cleric of the church of the god in question. The precise prayers uttered when designating a holy symbol is secret knowledge, passed down throughout the ages and well-guarded by the churches.

The actual object that constitutes a holy symbol varies by church. Holy symbols have evolved over history, in the sense that the churches have produced holy symbols of a variety of description, never settling on one specification for more than a few hundred years. Until recently, that is, as no church has imposed a change upon its holy symbol for at least the last 1,000 years.

Part 2 of this document is concerned with modern holy symbol design. Every holy symbol is a practical object of great symbolism. Understanding the symbolism is a worthy goal of both believers and scholars alike.

PART 2: The Illustrated Guide

CAILA: god of the harvest

[There is an illustration of...]
The holy symbol of Caila is a small, white, and rectangular cloth bag, sewn shut and containing a handful of grain. A vertical series of four ancient runes is embroidered upon the cloth surface with indigo thread.

The cloth bag contains purified rice; that is, rice blessed by a cleric of Caila in a special ceremony.

RUMIALYS: god of nature

[There is an illustration of a steel ring. A single thin bar runs through the center and connects two opposites edges of the ring.]
The holy symbol of Rumialys is a steel ring, about four inches wide, with a single thin bar running through the center and connecting two opposites edges of the ring.

The ring - a perfect circle - symbolizes both our planet Rumia as well as the many cyclic patterns that may be observed in nature. The center bar that runs the diameter of the circle represents the divine energy of Rumialys, and its presence in all of nature.
