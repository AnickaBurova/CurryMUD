RUMIALYS: god of nature

[There is an illustration of a steel ring. A single thin bar runs through the center and connects two opposites edges of the ring.]
The holy symbol of Rumialys is a steel ring, about four inches wide, with a single thin bar running through the center and connecting two opposites edges of the ring.

The ring - a perfect circle - symbolizes both our planet Rumia as well as the many cyclic patterns that may be observed in nature. The center bar that runs the diameter of the circle represents the divine energy of Rumialys, and its presence in all of nature.
