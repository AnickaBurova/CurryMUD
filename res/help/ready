USAGE:
ready item[#slocation] ...

DESCRIPTION:
Move one or more items from your inventory to your readied equipment.

For many items, you may optionally specify location by appending a suffix to the item name:
"#sr" for right (hand, wrist, or ear)
"#sl" for left  (hand, wrist, or ear)

For rings, you may optionally specify which finger of which hand. This is accomplished with a three-character suffix: either "#sr" for right hand or "#sl" for left hand, followed by:
"i" for index finger
"m" for middle finger
"r" for ring finger
"p" for pinky finger

If you do not provide a location suffix, the location will be chosen for you.
