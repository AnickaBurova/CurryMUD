\t\ READY \d\

\u\USAGE\n\
ready item[#slocation] ...

\u\DESCRIPTION\n\
Move one or more items from your inventory to your readied equipment.

For many items, you may optionally specify location by appending a suffix to the item name:
\q\"#sr"\d\ for right (hand, wrist, or ear)2`
\q\"#sl"\d\ for left  (hand, wrist, or ear)2`

For rings, you may optionally specify which finger of which hand. This is accomplished with a three-character suffix: either "#sr" for right hand or "#sl" for left hand, followed by:
\q\"i"\d\ for index finger2`
\q\"m"\d\ for middle finger2`
\q\"r"\d\ for ring finger2`
\q\"p"\d\ for pinky finger2`

If you do not provide a location suffix, the location will be chosen for you.
