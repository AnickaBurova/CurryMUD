\uDESCRIPTION\n
Display a report of connection statistics for one or more players.
For each PC name you provide, you will get a report beginning with whether or not the player is currently logged in. If the player is logged in, you will furthermore see the player's current IP address, followed by how long they have been logged in this session.
Next you will see a list of "host records." When a player logs out, a host record is generated (or updated) for the IP address from which that player connected. Each host record contains the following information:
* IP address.2`
* The number of times the player has logged out after having connected from said IP address.2`
* The total time the player has been connected from said IP address.2`
* The last date and time the player logged out after having connected from said IP address.2`
The list of host records is followed by the grand total time the player has been connected to CurryMUD.
