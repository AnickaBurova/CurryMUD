\uDESCRIPTION\n
Send a message on the admin channel.
When no arguments are provided, you'll get a list of all the admins who are currently logged in, indicating whether they have tuned the channel in or out.

\uADDRESSING A MESSAGE\d
Use \l#h\d to address your message to a particular person. For example, \q#dadmin \l#h\qhanako i'll take care of it\d will produce a message similar to the following (assuming your PC name is Taro):
(Admin) Taro: (to Hanako) I'll take care of it.

\uEMOTES\n
You can emote on the admin channel. Emotes must begin with a \l#x\d. As with the "emote" command, you may optionally specify where your PC name should appear using \l#e\d, and \l#r\d is used to specify a target. For example, \q#dadmin \l#x\qagrees wholeheartedly\d will produce a message similar to the following (assuming your PC name is Taro):
(Admin) Taro: [Taro agrees wholeheartedly.]

\uEXPRESSIVE COMMANDS\n
You can use expressive commands on the admin channel. Expressive commands must begin with a \l#p\d. For example, \q#dadmin \l#p\qcomfort hanako\d will produce a message similar to the following (assuming your PC name is Taro):
(Admin) Taro: <Taro comforts Hanako.>
