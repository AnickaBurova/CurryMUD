\h Z BACK DOOR \d

The "Z back door" allows you to quickly enter the virtual world as a new "ad hoc" character, entirely bypassing the character creation process, when you log in with a new name beginning with the letter "Z". The character's sex and race will be chosen at random.

This feature can be quite useful when you are testing new functionality, debugging, etc. In such a case, one often wants to enter the virtual world with a new character but doesn't want or need to spend time in character creation.

The back door is available if 1) debug commands are turned on, and 2) the "isZBackDoor" binding (set in Haskell code prior to compilation) is set to "True".
