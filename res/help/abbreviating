ABBREVIATING
============

The names of commands may be abbreviated down to their least significant characters.
This means, for example, that the "remove" command may be written "remove", "remov", "remo", or "rem"; "re", however, is an abbreviation of the "ready" command (this is due to the fact that "ready" alphabetically precedes "remove").
The names of things in the game world may also be abbreviated. Say, for example, you have the following items in your inventory:

[sack]     1 cloth sack`
[sword]    1 short sword`

"sack" can be abbreviated to "s", and "sword" can be abbreviated to "sw".
To disambiguate what one or more given abbreviations may refer to, use the "what" command. "what re rem", for example, will explain the different meanings of "re" and "rem".
