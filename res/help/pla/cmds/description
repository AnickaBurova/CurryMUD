\uDESCRIPTION\n
Change your character's description.
You will be shown your current description and asked whether or not you would like to change it.

\uRULES\n
In order to preserve the integrity of the virtual world along with the enjoyment of all, the following rules must be observed. Violation of these rules is grounds for discipline including banishment from CurryMUD.
1) Descriptions must be realistic and reasonable. A felinoid with an unusual fur color is acceptable, while a six-foot dwarf is not.3`
2) Descriptions must be passive and written from an objective viewpoint. "He is exceptionally thin" is acceptable, while "You can't believe how thin he is" is not.3`
3) Descriptions may only contain observable information. "People tend to ask her about her adventures" and "He is a true visionary among elves" are both illegal. Likewise, you may not include your character's name in your description.3`
4) Keep your description short. The longer your description, the less likely people are to actually read it!3`
5) You may not make radical changes to your description without a plausible in-game explanation. This means that it is normally illegal to make sudden, striking changes to enduring physical characteristics (height, eye color, etc.). If you would like to make such a change and feel there could be a plausible in-game explanation, get permission from an administrator first.3`
