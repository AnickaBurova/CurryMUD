\h ADMIN \d

\uUSAGE\n
admin \s[\dname message\s]\d

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Display a list of administrators, or send a message to an administrator.
When no arguments are provided, you'll get a list of CurryMUD administrators, indicating whether or not each administrator is currently logged in.

To send a message to an administrator, provide the administrator's name followed by a message. If the administrator is currently logged in, the message will be delivered immediately. If the administrator is logged out, the message will be retained (the administrator will see it the next time he/she logs in).
