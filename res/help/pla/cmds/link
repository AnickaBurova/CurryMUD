* Taro and Hanako are in the same room. They have already introduced themselves to each other via the "intro" command. (Both of these are prerequisites of linking).2`
* Taro links with Hanako. There is now a one-way link from Taro's mind to Hanako's mind. Each can now sense when the other is awake/asleep.2`
