\h ROOMDESC \d

\uUSAGE\n
roomdesc \s[\ddescription\s]\d

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Specify a temporary description to appear next to your name in the description of your current room.

For example, let's say you set your room description to "leaning against the signpost". Now when someone else in your current room executes the "look" command, he or she will see your character listed like so (assuming you are a male vulpenoid):

\oa male vulpenoid\d (leaning against the signpost) [\am\dvulpenoid]

If the person "look"ing knows your character's name (let's say it's Taro), he/she will instead see the following:

\kTaro\d (leaning against the signpost) [\at\daro]

-

When no arguments are provided to the "roomdesc" command, your room description will be cleared. (Your room description is automatically cleared when you move to a new room.)

Certain expressive commands will set or clear your room description for you.

Note that if it is set, the "stats" command will display your room description.

\uEXAMPLES\n
\qroomdesc sitting at a table\d to change your room description to "sitting at a table".4`
\qroomdesc\d to clear your room description.4`
