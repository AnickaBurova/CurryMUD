\h TUNE \d

\uUSAGE\n
tune \s[\dname=\s{\din\s|\dout\s|\don\s|\doff\s} ...]\d

\uDESCRIPTION\n
Tune in/out one or more telepathic connections, including both two-way links and channels. (When you tune a connection out, you temporarily close your mind to the telepathic thoughts originating from it.)
When no arguments are provided, you'll get a list of your telepathic connections, indicating whether each connection is presently tuned in or out.
To tune a connection in/out, provide arguments in the form of "name=value", where "name" is the name of a connection, and "value" is one of the following: "in" / "out", or the equivalent "on" / "off".
To tune in/out all your connections, specify "all=", as in "tune all=out".

Note: use the "question" command to tune the question channel (the "tune" command is for tuning IC channels).
