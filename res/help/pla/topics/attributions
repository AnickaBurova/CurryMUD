Special Notes for Included Code

If you split out the parts originally from other authors, and use them
completely independently of the rest of the library, you may treat them
under the licenses shown below.

-----

Portions of System.Path come from Volker Wysk's HsShellScript
library, version 2.1.0.  That code is Copyright (c) 2004 Volker Wysk
and was originally licensed under the GNU LGPL 2.1.  Volker gave permission
on Aug. 10, 2011, to John Goerzen to relicense it under the same 3-clause
BSD license as MissingH itself.

-----

Data.Hash.CRC32.Posix is
(C) 2002 HardCore SoftWare, Doug Hoyte
and is "distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL."  This license is
the same as the main license for MissingH.

The code was obtained from
http://cvs.sourceforge.net/viewcvs.py/haskell-libs/libs/crypto/crc32.hs

Data.Compression.Inflate is
Copyright 2004 Ian Lynagh

This library (libraries/process) is derived from code from two
sources:

  * Code from the GHC project which is largely (c) The University of
    Glasgow, and distributable under a BSD-style license (see below),

  * Code from the Haskell 98 Report which is (c) Simon Peyton Jones
    and freely redistributable (but see the full license for
