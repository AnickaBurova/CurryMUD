\h UNDOCUMENTED COMMANDS \d

There do exist "undocumented commands," meaning commands for which there is no help available via the "help" and "?" commands. You are meant to discover these commands in the course of your gameplay and exploration.

Typically, undocumented commands may only be used in certain rooms. One example is the "trash" command, which only works when you are in a room with a trash bin.

Keep in mind that the names of undocumented commands may not be abbreviated. \qtrash doll\d is legal, while \qtras doll\d, or any other abbreviated form, is not.
