\h TEXT EDITOR \d

A "text editor" is a type of software used to edit plain text files.

Occasionally, CurryMUD will prompt you to enter an extended, possibly multi-line, passage of text (when entering your character's description, for example). In such cases, you are encouraged to compose your text in an external text editor. When you've finished, simply copy the text and paste it into your MUD client.

A text editor will provide you with an array of editing functionality not available in your MUD client. In particular, composing multiple lines of text will certainly be easier in a text editor. Most text editors can check your spelling, too.

There is a wide variety of text editors available. Your operating system probably comes with a text editor (for example, TextEdit on Mac, and gedit or kate on Linux systems).
