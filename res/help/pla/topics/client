\h CLIENT \d

A "MUD client" is a type of software used to connect to a MUD server and play.

While there are a variety of MUD clients available, we recommend Mudlet and TinTin++ (CurryMUD has been tested extensively with both). These clients run on a variety of operating systems, are feature-rich, and free.

Mudlet is a GUI application; TinTin++, on the other hand, is a console application. For this reason, TinTin++ is better suited for "power users" who know their way around the command line/shell.

TinTin++ users: please execute the "##split" command to create a separate input and output area: CurryMUD works best with a client that has a dedicated field for input.
