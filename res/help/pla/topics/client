\h CLIENT \d

A "MUD client" is a type of software used to connect to a MUD server and play.

While there are a variety of MUD clients available, we recommend Mudlet and TinTin++ (CurryMUD has been tested extensively with both). These clients run on a variety of operating systems, are feature-rich, and free.

Mudlet is a GUI application; TinTin++, on the other hand, is a console application. For this reason, TinTin++ is better suited for "power users" who know their way around the command line/shell.
Mudlet users will want to take advantage of our custom scripts for displaying vitals gauges and mapping. See "help mudletscripts" for more information.

\uCLIENT CONFIGURATION\n

Mudlet users:
Please allow CurryMUD to handle line wrapping for you: using the CurryMUD "set" command, set "columns" to your desired line length. To ensure that Mudlet won't perform line wrapping, set your line length to a higher value in the Mudlet preferences ("Wrap lines at" under "Main display").
Other Mudlet preferences to change (optional): Check "Force new line on empty commands" under "Special Options." We also recommend checking "Auto clear the input line after you sent text" under "Input line," and changing the "Command separator" to something less common than the semicolon ("\\", for example).

TinTin++ users:
Please execute the "##split" command to create a separate input and output area: CurryMUD works best with a client that has a dedicated field for input. To account for the presence of the input area, you may need to decrease CurryMUD's "lines" setting by 2 (via the CurryMUD "set" command) or vertically expand your terminal window.
