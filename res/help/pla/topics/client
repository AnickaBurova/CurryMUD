\h CLIENT \d

A "MUD client" is a type of software used to connect to a MUD server and play.

While there are a variety of MUD clients available, we recommend Mudlet and TinTin++ (CurryMUD has been tested extensively with both). These clients run on a variety of operating systems, are feature-rich, and free.

Mudlet is a GUI application; TinTin++, on the other hand, is a console application. For this reason, TinTin++ is better suited for "power users" who know their way around the command line/shell.

\uCLIENT CONFIGURATION\n

Mudlet users:
Please allow CurryMUD to handle line wrapping for you: using the "set" command, set "columns" to your desired line length. To ensure that Mudlet won't perform line wrapping, set your line length to a higher value in the Mudlet preferences ("Wrap lines at" under "Main display").

TinTin++ users:
Please execute the "##split" command to create a separate input and output area: CurryMUD works best with a client that has a dedicated field for input. To account for the presence of the input area, you may need to increase CurryMUD's "lines" setting by 2 (via the "set" command) or vertically expand your terminal window.
