\h ROLE-PLAY \d

CurryMUD is a Role-Play Intensive (RPI) MUD. This means you are required to role-play, and role-playing is a primary focus and goal of gameplay. Your character is far more than a simple vehicle for killing monsters and collecting treasure: she is an individual with a unique personality and identity. She is unaware of you (the player) and the "real world."

You must stay In Character (IC) at all times, with a few exceptions (the question channel being one). You may not, for example, break character and chat with other players about real-world events. The CurryMUD virtual world is one of high fantasy inspired by Tolkien's Middle Earth. Players must be very careful to preserve the integrity of this fantasy world by never alluding to the "real world" when interacting with each other.

If you encounter a player who is not role-playing or is breaking character, please don't hesitate to contact the staff using the "admin" command.
