\h MAPPER \d

Mudlet users who have imported our custom scripts can take advantage of Mudlet's mapper functionality. (See "help mudletscripts" for information regarding how to obtain and import the relevant scripts.)

Select "Toolbox" -> "Show map" to view the mapper.

Significant rooms are assigned a text label automatically. Furthermore, rooms are color coded as follows:
Inside rooms: cyan
Outside rooms: light green
Shops: light red
"Special" rooms: light magenta
You can adjust these colors in Mudlet's preferences under "Mapper colors."

The CurryMUD "zoom" command can be used to adjust the zoom to your desired level.

Enjoy!
