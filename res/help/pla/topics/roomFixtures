\h ROOM FIXTURES \d

A "room fixture" is a permanent feature of a room (such as a sign) with which you can interact via one or more commands. Room fixtures are depicted in the static description of a room.

Frequently, you'll find that you can use everyday commands such as "look" and "read" to interact with room fixtures; however, in some cases, undocumented commands do exist.

Keep in mind that the names of room fixtures may not be abbreviated. \qlook sign\d is legal, while \qlook sig\d, or any other abbreviated form, is not.
