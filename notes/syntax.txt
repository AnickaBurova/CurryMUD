SENSORY COMMANDS

The following commands allow you to utilize your character's senses:
"touch", "taste", "smell", "listen"

Supply arguments to indicate one or more things to which you wish to apply your senses ("taste potion", "smell apple orange", etc.).
"touch" and "taste" require arguments. "smell" and "listen" may be used with or without arguments.

DEALING WITH COINS

Many commands that manipulate items can be used with coins. As such, coins are treated just like any other item. For example, "give 5/sp gp taro" will give five silver pieces and one gold piece to Taro.
For convenience, the "coin" keyword refers to all your coins as a whole. "give 'coin taro" will give all your coins to Taro.
The slash prefix may be used with "coin". In this case, coins are counted by denomination, from small to large. For example, if you have five copper, five silver, and five gold, "give 11/coin taro" will give Taro all your copper, all your silver, and one of your gold.
The "coin" keyword may not be abbreviated. "coins" is considered to be a synonym for "coin".

IC COMMUNICATION COMMANDS

The "shout" command is similar to "say", but your voice will reach players in adjacent rooms. Shouting costs FP.

You may "say" or "shout" in a racial language, as opposed to the common tongue. Use "sayelf" to say in elvish, "shoutfelinoid" to shout in felinoid, etc. See "help language" for more info.

Use the "tell" command to communicate telepathically. To do this, both you and the target PC of your "tell" must first establish a telepathic link with each other (see "help link" for more info). (In the following examples, the text to the right of the arrow represents what Hanako's player will see on her screen.)
"tell hanako I'll meet you in the tavern" -> [Taro] "I'll meet you in the tavern."2`

You can use emotes in tell commands to telepathically send an abstract thought or image.
"tell hanako ;is really at a loss" -> [Taro] Taro is really at a loss.2`

The built-in emotes may also be used, like so:
"tell hanako ;smile" -> [Taro] Taro smiles.2`
"tell hanako ;smile hanako" -> [Taro] Taro smiles at you.2`

Furthermore, emotes may be used in the IC channel commands. See "help channels" for more info.

EMOTES

If the at sign (@) appears in an emote, you character's name will be substituted for the at sign.
"emote shielding his eyes from the sun, @ looks out across the plains" -> Shielding his eyes from the sun, Taro looks out across the plains.2`

You may emote with your character's name in the possessive form, like so:
"emote @'s leg twitches involuntarily." -> Taro's leg twitches involuntarily.2`
"emote as he sits down, the wooden chair creaks under @'s weight." -> As he sits down, the wooden chair creaks under Taro's weight.2`

-----

OOC COMMUNICATION COMMANDS

"ooctell" is used strictly for OOC communication. You can send an "ooctell" to any player; it is not necessary for your characters to first establish a link. This command should be used sparingly, and only when necessary.
"ooctell hanako i have to afk for about 10 mins" -> [Taro] (OOC) I have to afk for about 10 mins.2`

The "question" channel is available for game-related questions. This channel is broadcast to all players who have not manually blocked it. See "help channels" for more info.
"question how can I throw something away?" -> [Question] Taro: How can I throw something away?2`

You cannot put emotes inside OOC communication commands.
