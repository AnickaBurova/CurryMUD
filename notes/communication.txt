Communication commands:

admin - send a msg to an admin / __Zaa__ Hello.
telepathic - send a msg to a linked person / [Taro] Greetings.

:admin - the admin channel / (Admin) Root: Hi hi. -- "Root" is underlined. On the admin channel, PC names are always given.
:message - msg a regular player / __Jason__ Ello?

Players should be prohibited from sending a message enclosed in square brackets.

=====

Ad-hoc channels:

Taro creates a channel simply by naming it. (Channel names are known IC.)
He then has Hanako join by connecting her to the channel. (He is already linked with Hanako. You can't connect a person who has tuned you out.)
Hanako can now connect anyone she is linked with.
Anyone is free to leave the channel at any time.
Anyone is free to boot someone from a channel at any time.
Channels may be tuned in and out at will.

newchannel hunt
connect hanako hunt
channel hunt hi

leave hunt

disconnect hanako hunt -- Must provide full name?

channel hunt
With no arguments, you'll get a list of who is currently tuned in to the channel. Names should be abbreviation-styled. (You must be tuned in to the channel yourself.)

-----

The names of the people you don't know on an ad-hoc channel are not given away. Instead, your PC's mind picks, by random association, something to symbolize the owner of the telepathic thoughts.

channel hunt hi
(Hunt) Taro: Hi.
(Hunt) apple: Hi. -- "apple" will be colorized or formatted in some way so as to indicate it is a random name.

Forms of "you" are only legal in telepathic emotes.

=====

Tuning in/out:

Either "in"/"out" or "on"/"off".
tune taro=in admin=out hunt=in
tune all=in

"tune" with no args will dump the status of every communication channel.

"tune" can be used to tune the admin channel. The functionality of tuning the channel in/out needs to be moved from the ":admin" command.
